h2. This is a fork of scribe for java 1.4

I updated the code to make it compile with a 1.4 compiler.
I also abstracted the default java HTTP out so I can rely on a separate HTTP provider in the package.

Please see the original product for more information.  If you find an issue in my translation of the project, 
please let me know.  thanks!
